# CapstoneProject
Capstone project of Google Data Analytics Certificate Program

Welcome to the Bellabeat data analysis case study! In this case study, you will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. You will imagine you are working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will help you stay on the right path.
